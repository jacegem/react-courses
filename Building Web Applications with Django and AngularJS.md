# Learning Django and AngularJS

In this tutorial you will build a simplifed Google+ clone called "Not Google Plus" with Django and Angular JS.

Before we hit the proverbial books and learn to build a rich, modern web application with Django and Angular, let's take a moment to explore the motivations behind this tutorial and how you can get the most out of it.

## What is the goal of this tutorial?

Here at Thinkster, we strive to create high value, in depth content while maintaining a low barrier to entry. We release this content for free with the hope that you find it both exciting as well as infromative.

Each tutorial we release has a specific goal. In this tutorial, that goal is to give you a brief overview of how Django and Angular JS play together and how these technologies can be combined to build amazing web applications. Furthermore, we place a heavy emphasis on building good engineering habits. This includes everything from considering the tradeoffs that come from making architectural decisions, to maintaining high quality code throughout your project. While these things may not sound like fun, they are key to becoming a well-rounded software developer.

## Who is this tutorial for?

Every author must answer this difficult question. Our goal is to make this tutorial useful for novices as well as experienced developers.

For those of you who are in the early days of your software development careers. we have tired to be thorought and logical in our explanations as possible, while still making the text flow fluidly; we try to avoid making intuitive leaps where doing so makes sense.

For those of you who have been around the block a few times, and perhaps are just interested in learning more about Django or Angular JS, we know you don't need the basic explained to you. Once of our goals when writing this tutorial was to make it easy to skim. This allows you to use your existing knowledge to speed up the reading process and identify where unfamiliar concepts are presented so you can grok[^grok] them and move on.

[^grok]: 진정으로 이해하다, 공감하다.

We want to make this tutorial accessible to anyone with enough interest to take the time necessary to learn and understand the concepts presented.

## A brief interlude about formatting

Throughout this turorial, we strive[^strive] to maintain consistent formatting. This sention details what that formatting looks like and what it means.

## A final word before we begin

It is our experience that the developers who gain the most from our tutorials are the ones who take an active approach to their learning

We **strongly** recommend you tyep out the code for yourself. When you copy and past code, you don't interact with it and that interaction is in turn what makes you a better developer.

In addition to typing the code yourself, do not be afraid to get you hands dirty; jump in and play around, break things and build missing features. If you encounter a bug, explore and figure out what is casuing it. Thses are ther obstacles we as engineers must tackle multiple times a day, and have thus learned to embrace these explorations as the best source of learning.
